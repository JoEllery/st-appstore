1) my food was delivered in the middle of winter by someone on a bicycle. No protective bag or basket to put the food in, just a bag of heavy, hot food exposed the the freezing winter air, dangling on someone‚Äôs bike. When it finally arrived nearly 2 hours after placing the order (the restaurant was only 1.2 miles away from my house and should not have taken that long) , it was freezing cold. I felt worse for the poor delivery guy that had to ride on poorly lit, winding roads in the middle of winter. He even states that he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt supposed to‚Äù be making deliveries over a certain amount of mileage away).
2) I ordered food from a location that was 3 miles away from my house (10 minutes drive) got a notification that it was picked up, and that it would be delivered in 10 minutes. Makes sense... after checking the app 10 minutes later, when the order should have arrived, it continued to say it was 10 minutes away. The tracking showed that the driver was in the complete opposite direction of our house and the restaurant. After checking another 10 minutes later, the driver was still in the same spot. Another 10 minutes, and they were still there. We called and he said he was ‚Äúdriving and is on his way‚Äù. After a few minutes he started moving, but was still going in the opposite direction.

Unfortunately, I will no longer be using the (eats) service due to the rising booking fees. I could understand the fees based on distance for standalone companies hiring their own drivers. Uber has drivers who are intending to drive these distances for pay and can continue with more rides after leaving the destination (home) rather than having to drive back to the starting destination (restaurant). A pizza delivery through the pizza company 5 minutes away has a 50% lower delivery cost than Uber does for a restaurant in the same general area (within .2 miles). This is unacceptable. I guarantee you will continue to lose customers, as I already know of several other who are moving to your competitors for this very reason. I‚Äôm disappointed I will not be ordering my favorite tonight through Uber eats because it is $9 for a 10 minute drive. The restaurants are already inflating their prices from their in store prices. Don‚Äôt add to the problem.

Update: 2 days go by since the initial review. I opened the app out of curiosity and was welcomed by a notification touting lowered booking fees.

He also interrupted me repeatedly and didn‚Äôt allow me to explain what I needed.

So, without the order ever even coming within 20 minute radius even near my wife my card gets charged because the driver was given a heads up by Uber eats to cancel my order i.e. mark it as completed.

When reaching out to the support via Twitter, the agent threatened to ban my account if I continued asking for a refund on an order in which I received only one of six items ordered, clearly shown in the picture taken by the driver of the food at my door. The driver had even notified support before delivering the food that the entire order could not be delivered. Since Uber is the one placing the order, I cannot reach out directly to the vendor for a refund, so Uber and the vendor can simply pocket that money and give me absolutely nothing. I have had hundreds of dollars worth of food not delivered to me, and Ubers response some is an automated one; ‚ÄúThese orders are not eligible for a refund‚Äù.",1,False,Reviewer 5567,Run by Robots

I proceeded to call my cousin nacho, he told me I was break dancing and doing the head spin on the Dance floor. Which explained why I was not able to get out of bed. The hang over was killing me and I was disabled. I had no way of getting up from bed worse yet getting out of the house. So I was starving for 4 days with no food at home but was in too much pain from the illicit moves that I was not able to leave the house.

I went to the Help section of the app to see if I could leave a complaint or comment but no, I could only rate and comment on the restaurant itself.

The other reason is the customer support. They understand fast food restaurants tend to mess up your order and they do their part in fixing it. If your curious the issue with the UI is it‚Äôs not clear what address you are delivering the food to before you click submit. Make the delivery text in bold large text so it‚Äôs obvious. The second issue is your service charge is based on a percentage of the meal. Meaning I am penalized for ordering more food. This practice hurts the tips of the drivers delivering the food as well as the restaurants your users are ordering from since it‚Äôs more cost effective to order less.

2023-11-11 20:30:00,,"I recently had an experience with the Uber Eats app that left me disappointed and compelled me to share my feedback. The primary issue I encountered was the lack of transparency in pricing. When I ordered a meal listed at $20, I was under the impression that this would be the approximate total cost. However, to my surprise, the final price charged was $33. This significant discrepancy between the initial price shown and the final price was both misleading and frustrating.

The app, while user-friendly in its interface and offering a wide range of food options, fails significantly in providing customers with a clear understanding of the total costs they will incur. This includes hidden charges like delivery fees, service fees, and taxes, which are not clearly disclosed at the outset. The absence of a feature to view the full price breakdown before placing an order is a major oversight.

This experience has led me to the decision to uninstall the Uber Eats app and look for other food delivery services that offer greater transparency in their pricing. It's crucial for consumers to be fully informed about the costs they are committing to, and unfortunately, in this instance, Uber Eats did not meet this standard.

It's happened numerous times when I've waited hours for food because they're slow just for them to deliver it to the wrong place. I've also had many encounters with drivers that can't speak English which wouldn't matter at all if the Uber navigation system was accurate but since it's not I have to give driving directions and it's hard to do when it's not one of the two languages I can communicate in. And since Postmates has been acquired by Uber it is now ruined as well so I will be trying my luck with DoorDash.

2022-11-27 18:57:13,,"Received a promo for $30 off a grocery delivery.

All the prices were about 30+ cents more expensive on Uber eats. I created the same delivery order in the grocery‚Äôs app and the total after taxes and hidden ‚Äúfees‚Äù (about $15 on Uber) came to $6 less compared to Uber eats and that included a 20% tip where the Uber eats total did not, so it would have been even more expensive. Note there was no promo used on the grocer‚Äôs app other than automatically applied coupons. 

The odd thing is I‚Äôm pretty sure the Grocer still goes through Uber eats for delivery. Perhaps it‚Äôs door dash.. Crazy how an order on Uber Eats with $30 in promo credits costed more for the same items BEFORE adding a tip. Additionally, this cost comparison would still hold true even if I got an Uber eats membership which would have saved an additional $7 unless I didn‚Äôt tip on Uber eats for a total savings of $1 (which is lost to the membership fee).

There was one time in particular where practically the entire order had been messed up and I called the restaurant to inform them, not asking for anything, just wanted to make sure they were double checking every order and got into a 20 minute argument with the girl about how the tickets don‚Äôt show the customizations when they stapled a receipt to the bag that showed all the customizations I put in in BIG RED LETTERS!!

I think if you order from a further location with priority and someone closer also orders it will let the driver take both orders and not tell the priority customer that someone is ahead of them, I pay for priority to not have to wait.

She said she had 3 other stops to make!!! So not only was my food going to be over an hour late, it was going to be cold!

Firstly I did not receive any response in 15 hrs. So I raised the request again. I have never wrote a review on AppStore. But this time it‚Äôs quite frustrating as the support manager says that they cannot give a refund this time as it will be not fair for everyone using the app. I didn‚Äôt understand.

They only charged me twice because they hold the amount and then they charge the amount and that it should drop off my bank account in a few days.

Customer service support could be so much better. I understand that these are difficult times for everyone, but for such a popular service to let me down three times in a row is telling. I didn‚Äôt even receive my food the last attempt. This app had me wait for an hour just to tell me my order was cancelled. I called the restaurant I ordered from as I was willing to pick the food up if it was ready, despite the fact that I opted for delivery. The restaurant never received my order in the first place. I received a refund for my order, but this shouldn‚Äôt have been an issue to begin with, especially since I waited for an hour for my order to essentially be thrown into a vacuum, never to be seen by the restaurant I ordered from. So depending on where you‚Äôre located, receiving your food is a coin toss with this app. The chances of you getting your food are pretty high, but on the flip side you face lack of reliability, remorse, and accountability, and sometimes refunds and promo codes can‚Äôt adequately masquerade that bad taste in your mouth.",1,False,MissMojo99,So Upsetting as of Recently...

However, my recent experience has compelled me to reassess my loyalty. During my last order, I encountered two significant issues. Firstly, an order from one of the restaurants included an item to which I am severely allergic, rendering my meal inedible. Subsequently, the delivery from a second restaurant failed to reach me. Upon seeking assistance from Uber Eats customer service, I was met with a refusal for both aid and a refund. This incident is not isolated but part of a recurring pattern of neglect towards customer satisfaction. Despite my expectation for some level of accountability, especially when it concerns the basic fulfillment of services, my hopes were dashed. This disregard for customer care and service failure has led me to uninstall the Uber Eats app. I have since registered with DoorDash and Grubhub, in search of a platform that values its customers and ensures the delivery of services paid for.

Another problem (although some what minor), is that the restaurant don‚Äôt provide you with utensils.

2024-01-03 01:13:25,,"There are many restaurants that have items on their menu with prices that are impossible to actually get the items for. This is because when you choose the item, the next window forces you to choose an add-on that costs more money (with no free option).

Uber should hold the restaurant accountable when an error is made so the customer can still get their money back for the missing or incorrect item/s.

Uber Eats took it upon themselves to sidestep this limitation by simply adding yet another fee they call the ‚ÄúState of Oregon regulation‚Äú.

Absolutely ridiculous! 

The menu prices for items on Uber eats are significantly higher than the menu prices on the actual restaurant menus, and Uber adds on a service fee, delivery fee, and expects you to tip on top of that. As an example, I went to the website for one of my favorite sandwich shops, and the sandwich price was $14. On Uber eats the price was $18 for the sandwich, plus a service fee, a delivery fee, and of course the tip.

2020-09-09 03:34:12,,"I rarely review or rate things in general, but I am so beyond over Uber Eats and have erased it from my phone. I‚Äôve noticed over the past six months that orders ALWAYS take twice as long as quoted and I believe it‚Äôs because they are batching so many deliveries with one driver to save themselves money. I just had a driver accidentally mark my order complete after already being much later than quoted due to two other stops ‚Äúalong the way‚Äù and because it was marked delivered they could no longer see my address or contact info. Another 30 minutes later support calls asking permission to give the driver my address...and proceeded to give the driver the WRONG address entirely. An order that said would take 30-40 mins. ended up taking 2 hours.

I work at a restaurant and see their business from the other side as well.... Uber Eats orders always sit on our counter for an extra 30 minutes because the drivers show up so late (assuming due to Uber again stretching them too thin on many orders in order to make more money for themselves.)

Do yourself a favor. Screw Uber eats. Use DoorDash or Postmates. I‚Äôm done.",1,False,Weston227,Officially done with Ubereats
2020-08-27 23:42:49,,"Don‚Äôt get this app, don‚Äôt buy anything from them. They just wait for the chance to stiff you out of money. I ordered a foot long sandwich so that I had lunch and dinner set up...6 in was given. When I reported the item was wrong.....‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù was flagged so I had to send an image. I took a picture and reported it literally seconds after I received my order. I got an e-mail back from ‚Äúcustomer support ‚Äú (if you can call them that) saying that because of the amount of reports on my account they wouldn‚Äôt adjust the order this time even with photo proof that THEY ASKED FOR!!! I think everyone who has used this app can agree that if you order a lot (which we have been because of COVID) they are NOT going to get every order right, but if you don‚Äôt get what you pay for isn‚Äôt that some sort of false advertising? I‚Äôm just curious to see the DEV response to this because honestly you people can‚Äôt convince me to use your services ever again that includes the drivers. I feel sorry for the people relying on this income during this time, but I guess that‚Äôs up to you to explain why so many users are leaving.",1,False,Not gonna give you,0 stars
